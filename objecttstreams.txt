What Are Object Streams?

Object Streams are used to read and write Java objects (not just text or numbers) to files or over a network.
They are part of Java I/O and allow:

Saving (serializing) objects
Reading (deserializing) objects

Classes Used in Object Streams:

| Class                | Purpose                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `ObjectOutputStream` | Write/save object to file  |
| `ObjectInputStream`  | Read/load object from file |


Notes on Object Streams:

The class must implement Serializable interface (marker interface, no methods inside).
You can store full objects into files and recreate them later â€” this is called serialization and deserialization.
transient keyword can be used to skip a variable from being saved.
