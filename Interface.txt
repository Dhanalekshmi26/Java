 What is an Interface?
An interface in Java is a blueprint that defines a set of abstract methods that a class must implement.
It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java


 Like a TV remote interface — every brand must have the same buttons (methods), but each does it in their own way!

  Implementing an Interface
->class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
A class must implement all methods of the interface.

Why Use Interfaces?

Achieve 100% abstraction
Support multiple inheritance (Java doesn’t support it via classes)
Used in real frameworks, e.g., Spring, Selenium, Android, etc.

Real World Analogy:
Interface = "USB Port"
Any device (Mouse, Keyboard, Pendrive) must follow USB rules.
Even though devices are different, the interface (USB) is common.

interface demo:
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts with key");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car c = new Car();
        c.start();  // Output: Car starts with key
    }
}
