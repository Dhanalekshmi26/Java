 What is a Package in Java?
Think of a package as a folder that stores related Java files.

Like: myapp/
      └── math/
        └── Calculator.java


Why use packages?

Organize code
Avoid name conflicts
Protect access (like private/public)
Reuse code

How to define a package?

package mypackage;  // top of your file

public class Hello {
    public void sayHi() {
        System.out.println("Hi from package!");
    }
}


How to import a package?
In another file:

import mypackage.Hello;  // use Hello class from mypackage

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Hello obj = new Hello();
        obj.sayHi();
    }
}


What is CLASSPATH?

It's a path Java uses to find classes and packages.
You can set CLASSPATH so Java knows where to look.
set CLASSPATH = C:\myjava\mypackage
-> If you don’t set it, Java may say “class not found”.


Real Life Example
Imagine your phone has:

call app
camera app
music app

Each is like a package! You import them when needed.
